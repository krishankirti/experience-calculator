                <p>Coffee is one of the most popular beverages worldwide, and for good reason. It’s versatile, energizing, and can be customized to suit your taste. But have you ever wondered how many calories are in your favorite cup of coffee with milk and sugar? Let’s dive into the details to find out.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Understanding Coffee Calories</h2>
                <p>A plain cup of black coffee contains almost no calories, usually under 5 per serving. However, when you add milk and sugar, the calorie count increases. The exact number of calories depends on the type and amount of milk and sugar used.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Average Calorie Breakdown</h2>
                <p>Here’s an approximate calorie count for an 8-ounce (240 ml) cup of coffee with milk and sugar:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Whole Milk (30 ml or 2 tablespoons):</strong> 18-20 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>Sugar (1 teaspoon):</strong> 16 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>Coffee (plain):</strong> 2-5 calories</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This means a standard cup of coffee with 2 tablespoons of whole milk and 1 teaspoon of sugar contains about <strong>40-45 calories</strong>. The calorie count increases if you add more milk or sugar.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Variations Based on Milk Types</h2>
                <p>The type of milk you choose significantly impacts the calorie count. Here’s a quick breakdown:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Skim Milk (30 ml):</strong> 10 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>2% Milk (30 ml):</strong> 15 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>Soy Milk (unsweetened, 30 ml):</strong> 8-10 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>Almond Milk (unsweetened, 30 ml):</strong> 5-7 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>Cream (30 ml):</strong> 50-60 calories</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Switching to low-calorie milk options like almond or skim milk can reduce the overall calorie intake significantly.</p>

            <section>
                <h2>Sugar Matters Too</h2>
                <p>Sugar is a major contributor to coffee’s calorie content. If you use:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>1 teaspoon of sugar:</strong> 16 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>1 tablespoon of sugar:</strong> 48 calories</li>
                    <li><strong>Artificial Sweeteners:</strong> 0-5 calories (depending on the brand)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Reducing sugar or replacing it with a low-calorie sweetener can make your coffee healthier without compromising flavor.</p>
